# Building an interactive visualization

A Coursera assignment based on Figure 2(c) from the paper [Sample-oriented task-driven visualizations: allowing users to make better, more confident decisions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ferreira_Fisher_Sample_Oriented_Tasks.pdf) Ferreira, N., Fisher, D., & Konig, A. C. (2014, April). 

Users are able to compare a given value to the probability distributions represented by the error bars. Users click on the image to select a value; the probability that the distribution is larger than the selected value is mapped as a color on each bar using a divergent color scale.
